      A integer. The total steps the model has run.

   .. attribute:: start_step

      A integer. When to trigger pruning process.

   .. attribute:: end_step

      A integer. When to end pruning process.

   .. attribute:: update_frequency_on_step

      A integer. The pruning frequency, which's valid when iterative
      pruning is enabled.

      Weights are multipled with masks. This is the formal pruning process.


   .. py:method:: on_step_begin(local_step)

      Functions called on the beginning of each step.

      Judge if the current step should execute a pruning process.
      If so, using scores and criteria to update the masks and pruning the model.
      Or, simply train the model with its original structure.
