## Introduction

[SigOpt](https://app.sigopt.com/) is an online model development platform that makes it easy to track runs, visualize training, and scale hyperparameter optimization for any type of model. [Optimization Loop](https://app.sigopt.com/docs/overview/optimization) is the backbone of using SigOpt. We can set metrics and realize the interaction between the online platform and tuning configurations based on this mechanism.

### Preparation

Before using the `SigOpt` strategy, a SigOpt account is necessary.
- Each account has its own API token. Find your API token and then fill it in the `sigopt_api_token` field. 
- Create a new project and fill the corresponding name into the `sigopt_project_id` field.
- Set the name of this experiment in `sigopt_experiment_id` field optionally. The default name is "nc-tune".

### SigOpt Platform 

If you are using the SigOpt products for the first time, please [sign-up](https://app.sigopt.com/signup), if not, please [login](https://app.sigopt.com/login). It is free to apply for an account. Although there are certain restrictions on the model parameters and the number of experiments created, it is sufficient for ordinary customers. If you want higher capacity, please contact support@sigopt.com.

After logging in, you can use `the token api` to connect the local code to the online platform, corresponding to `sigopt_api_token`. It can be obtained [here](https://app.sigopt.com/tokens/info).

SigOpt has two concepts: [project](https://app.sigopt.com/projects) and [experiment](https://app.sigopt.com/experiments). Create a project before experimenting, corresponding to `sigopt_project_id` and `sigopt_experiment_name`. Multiple experiments can be created on each project. After creating the experiment, SigOpt will execute three simple steps below in a loop:

- Receive a Suggestion from SigOpt;
- Evaluate your metrics;
- Report an Observation to SigOpt;

In our build-in sigopt strategy, the metrics add accuracy as a constraint and optimize for latency.

### Neural Compressor Configuration

Compare to `Basic` strategy, `sigopt_api_token` and `sigopt_project_id` is necessary for `SigOpt` strategy. Before using the strategy, it is required to create the project corresponding to `sigopt_project_id` in your account.

```python
from neural_compressor.config import PostTrainingQuantConfig, TuningCriterion

conf = PostTrainingQuantConfig(
    tuning_criterion=TuningCriterion(
        strategy="sigopt",
        strategy_kwargs={
            "sigopt_api_token": "YOUR-ACCOUNT-API-TOKEN",
            "sigopt_project_id": "PROJECT-ID",
            "sigopt_experiment_name": "nc-tune",
        },
    ),
)
```

## Performance

### Benefit of SigOpt Strategy

- Metric based SigOpt is better than self-defining and easy to use. You can read the details [here](https://app.sigopt.com/docs/overview/metric_constraints). 
- With the token api, results of each experiment are recorded in your account. You can use the SigOpt data analysis function to analyze the results, such as drawing a chart, calculating the F1 score, etc.
