# Introduction
## Install Intel® Neural Compressor with Bench
To install Install Intel® Neural Compressor with GUI install full version of Intel® Neural Compressor in one of following ways:
### Option 1 Install from binary

```Shell
# install stable full version from pip (including GUI)
pip install neural-compressor-full

# install nightly full version from pip (including GUI)
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ neural-compressor-full

# install stable full version from from conda (including GUI)
conda install neural-compressor-full -c conda-forge -c intel  
```

### Option 2 Install from source

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor.git
cd neural-compressor
pip install -r requirements.txt
# build with full functionality (including GUI)
python setup.py --full install
```

## Start the Intel® Neural Compressor Bench

To start the Intel® Neural Compressor Bench server execute `inc_bench` command:

```shell
inc_bench
```
The server generates a self-signed TLS certificate and prints instruction how to access the Web UI.

```text
Intel(r) Neural Compressor Bench Server started.

Open address https://10.11.12.13:5000/?token=338174d13706855fc6924cec7b3a8ae8
```

Server generated certificate is not trusted by your web browser, you will need to accept usage of such certificate.


You might also use additional parameters and settings:
* Intel® Neural Compressor Bench listens on port 5000.
Make sure that port 5000 is accessible to your browser (you might need to open it in your firewall),
or specify different port that is already opened, for example 8080:
    ```shell
    inc_bench -p 8080
    ```

* When using official TF>=2.6.0, set environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=1` for INT8 tuning:
    ```shell
    TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=1 inc_bench
    ```

* To start the Intel® Neural Compressor Bench server with your own TLS certificate add `--cert` and `--key` parameters:

    ```shell
    inc_bench --cert path_to_cert.crt --key path_to_private_key.key
    ```

* To start the Intel® Neural Compressor Bench server without TLS encryption use `--allow-insecure-connections` parameter:

    ```shell
    inc_bench --allow-insecure-connections
    ```

    This enables access to the server from any machine in your local network (or the whole Internet if your server is exposed to it).

    You are forfeiting security, confidentiality and integrity of all client-server communication. Your server is exposed to external threats.

## Home screen
This view shows introduction to Intel® Neural Compressor Bench and a button for creating new project. After clicking this button, pop-up with project wizard will be shown.

![Home](imgs/bench/home.png "Home")

# Create new project
To create a new project, in first step you need to choose its name.

![Project1](imgs/bench/project1.png "Project1")

In second step there are 2 possible options to choose from: 
* *predefined model* - you choose model from predefined examples list, you don't need to set any additional parameters,
* *custom model* - in this scenario you can set more parameters and customize your model. 

![Project2](imgs/bench/project2.png "Project2")

## Predefined model
First you need to choose domain for the model (image recognition or object detection). For each domain there are few available models to choose from. When you click *Finish* the chosen model will be downloaded.

![Project3-predefined](imgs/bench/project3-predefined.png "Project3-predefined")

## Custom model

First you have to choose the model path. When it is chosen, in most cases all other fields will be completed automatically. You can edit its input and output nodes, see the model graph (if it is available for this model) and set shape for synthetic dataset. If model domain was not detected, you need to choose it from the list. Model domain is used to set some default parameters for the model.

![Project3-custom](imgs/bench/project3-custom.png "Project3-custom")


## Display model graph
For several model types there will be a button available ![Show graph](imgs/bench/show_graph_button.png "Show graph") in the project wizard. It is also possible to see the graph in Diagnosis tab. The graph by default is collapsed, but when you click on plus icon, sections will be unfolded.
